### Recipe for Creating New DadLibs Stories

1. **Define the Title:**
   - Start with a catchy and descriptive title that sets the tone for your story. For example: "My Trip to the Moon".

2. **Craft the Story Template:**
   - Write a two or three-paragraph story with a silly and whimsical narrative.
   - Ensure that it has a clear beginning, middle, and end for a complete narrative arc.

3. **Identify the Blanks:**
   - Select words or phrases in the story that can be replaced with placeholders.
   - Common placeholders include adjectives, nouns, verbs, adverbs, places, and names.

4. **Organize Placeholders:**
   - Make a list of the types of words needed for the placeholders, such as `[noun]`, `[verb]`, `[adjective]`, etc.

5. **Create Word Options:**
   - For each type of placeholder, provide a selection of words that fit the context and enhance the silliness of the story. Don't repeat any of the words.

6. **Format as JSON:**
   - Structure the story and word options in JSON format, suitable for loading into your DadLibs game.

7. **Review and Test:**
   - Proofread the story and test it in the game to ensure it provides a fun and engaging experience.
